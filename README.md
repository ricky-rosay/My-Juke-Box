# <My-Juke-Box>

## Description

Application that will give you random music when you feel like having random music. Application will prompt a like and dislike button which will be used to gather data which will then be used to give you more of what you like and less of what you don't.

Although using the Spotify API… music applications just charge too much. Why go to an application that requires so much personal info to get you started? Music apps tend to basically steal your identity by asking for first name, last name, DOB, country or region, social security… okay maybe not that one. Then you need to agree to terms and conditions. What even is that? What are you agreeing to? Who knows maybe you’re giving away the naming rights to your first child. Our application makes it simple to use by simply using an email address and password to get started.

as a user i want an application that will give me music when i dont know what i want to listen to
kind of like a modernized radio.

## Installation

To install this great applicatioon all you need to do is clone the repo, run "npm install, change the password to MySQL in config.json to your own, run "npm start", then finally head over to localhost:3000.
